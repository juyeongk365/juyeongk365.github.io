### CPSC 120

*Lab 12, part 2 was one of my favorites because I was able to experience how to produce colors and texts at the same time. I always wanted to know how computers were able to display colorful images and texts. Thanks to this lab assignment, I was able to clearly see and learn how to create animations with programming. When I finished the code, I felt proud of myself and I was just staring at my screen endlessly. I couldn’t believe that I created this! It was truly a magical experience for me. 

*Lab 5, part 3 was one of my favorites because it was very fun programming the BlackJack game. As I was working on my lab assignment, I was able to experience how game developers program their games and I felt like I was slowly becoming like the game developers I admired since I was young. I was very proud of myself for being able to create simple games like BlackJack. It might be a simple program, but thanks to this lab assignment, my love for programming got stronger. Now I have a clear understanding of how games are first developed.

*Lab 2, part 3 was definitely one of my favorites because it was the moment when I first understood how computers work. I still remember how hard and scary computer programs looked for me because I didn’t understand anything. It might look silly looking back right now, but I actually had a hard time doing this assignment. I didn’t know what the C++ Google Style Guide was and I always had errors in this lab assignment. I spend a lot of time compiling and re-editing the code and that was when I slowly realized how computers functioned.
